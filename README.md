# Hashcode

These are solutions for some Hashcode competitions. For problem statements and datasets visit the Hashcode oficial site.

You should create directories **data** and **outputs** in every project. Those directories contain the datasets and the answers for the problems respectively.

Each project contains a run file in the **src** directory that can be invoked with the name of the input dataset and the name of the output file as parameters.

The requirements for each project are included.
